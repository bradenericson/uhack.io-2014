Uhack.io 24-hour programming Competition 

Our Prompt:

Demonstrate a new way to find, acquire or share products & purchases
- How can you innovate the way people find what to buy?
- Can you come up with a way to evaluate products that is an alternative to the traditional customer reviews? 
- How about innovating the possible ways to navigate or experience the retail/shopping experience?


Our Project:
Trufit is a web application designed to make shopping for clothing online easier. When you shop for clothing online,
you don't know if the item you're looking at will fit, or if the reviews people are leaving about it apply to you. We tried to
solve that problem by creating an app that shows you clothing and reviews based off input of users of similar stature. 

First, a user creates an account. During the registration process, the user adds their height, waist, pants length, tshirt size, etc.
Once we have those numbers, we can filter out the clothing we show them. The idea is to show them items that have positive feedback from
other people of similar stature, and will only show the reviews left by people of the same size. This creates a truly personalized
shopping experience. The user can now be sure that the items they are shopping for will fit.

The Design:
will be added later.

The Result:
